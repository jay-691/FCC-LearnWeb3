## Voting

People usually vote for what they want as a change for the org.

Can be used for bad as people can buy a lot of votes then sell them later on.

## Skin In The Game

If you buy a lot of votes or tokens, if the thing you voted for happens to hurt the DAO,
you don't have the option to sell your votes later. So you loose your money.

## Proof of Personhood

You get 1 vote for one participation.
But there is a problem called Sybil Resistance. It's hard to make sure that it's 1 person per vote.
Instead of 1000 votes per person.
