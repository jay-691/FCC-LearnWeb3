# NFT Marketplace
## Thank Free-Code-Camp and mostly Patrick Collins

In this lesson I will be building a decentralized NFT Marketplace.
I will be able to:
  1. `listItem`: List NFTs on the marketplace.
  2. `buyItem`: Buy the NFTs.
  3. `cancelItem`: Cancel a listing.
  4. `updateListing`: Update price.
  5. `withdrawProceeds`: Withdraw payment for my bought NFT.
