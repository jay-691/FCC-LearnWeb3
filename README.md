# 32 Hour - Learn Web3 - Free Code Camp

## Big thank you to [Patrick Collins](https://twitter.com/PatrickAlphaC) and [FreeCodeCamp](https://twitter.com/freeCodeCamp).

### This was a great course to take and I feel like I know the basics of Web3, Solidity and more, which from this course is enough to get started in the Web3 Development community.

Things I learnt from this course:

- Solidity - I now know the basics to write my own contracts and some more advanced knowledge.
- Hardhat - I can now confidently deploy and interact with my contracts on the frontend.
- Chainlink - I now know some great contracts and reasources provided by Chainlink to elevate my application.
- OpenZeppelin - Learning about the ERC and other contracts OpenZeppelin will allow me to write safe and efficent code thanks to the community.
- Alchemy - Using forking and Mempools to efficiently test my application.
- Moralis - Speeding up development with their built in packages.
- Etherscan - This course has taught me how to view my contracts on Etherscan and have then verified. I can now read Etherscan and understand what information is being presented to me from there.
- NFT's - I now understand what is under the hood of an NFT, the contracts they use and the steps it takes to create and deploy my own NFT.
- Terminology - I now understand the terminology used in the community like DeFi and DAO's.
